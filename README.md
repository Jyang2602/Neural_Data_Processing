Matlab scripts to compact, process, and visualize internal excitability of cell and various optogenetic responses

These are the scripts I use to compact, analyze, and visualize raw data collected from optogenetic experiments. The Compress_TAq_Jy script takes sweeps of separate conditions and compacts them into matrices to analyze. The visualizeOptoData takes the average of multiple sweeps and combines across conditions to easily visualize potential patterns in neural responses. The AnalyzeExcitability script takes the internal excitability of cells by voltage and finds the number of spikes by voltage intensity. This allows the user to easily visualize the cell health of individual cells along with general patterns across cell groups (PV vs pyramidal neurons.
